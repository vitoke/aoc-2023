# aoc-2023

Advent of Code 2023 implementations for fun and profit.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo
2. run `npm i`
3. Each puzzle can be run using `npm run exec <puzzle source locaion> <puzzle input file>`

So running puzzle 1 will be:
`npm run exec src/<user>/01.mts example-inputs/01.txt`

You can put your personal inputs from the aoc site into the `personal-inputs/` folder. Files in this folder will be git ignored, so
now worries about other people getting hold of your personal inputs.

That's it, have fun!

## Contributing

Feel free to add your solutions by either forking or asking to be added to the repo.
